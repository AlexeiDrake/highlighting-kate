highlighting-kate is a Haskell source code highlighting library, based
on Kate's syntax description files.

Currently, the following languages are supported:

Ada        Asp           Awk             Bash             Bibtex
C          Cmake         Coldfusion      Commonlisp       Cpp
Css        D             Diff            Djangotemplate   Doxygen
Dtd        Eiffel        Erlang          Fortran          Haskell
Html       Java          Javadoc         Javascript       Json
Latex      Lex           LiterateHaskell Lua              Makefile
Matlab     Mediawiki     Nasm            Objectivec       Objectivecpp
Ocaml      Pascal        Perl            Php              Postscript
Prolog     Python        Ruby            Scala            Scheme
Sgml       Sql           SqlMysql        SqlPostgresql    Tcl
Texinfo    Xml           Xslt            Yacc

To install:

    runghc Setup.lhs configure
    runghc Setup.lhs build 
    runghc Setup.lhs install 

The last command must be run as root, or --user may be specified to install
the library into the user package database.

Haddock documentation can be generated (in dist/doc/html/highlighting-kate)
using

    runghc Setup.lhs haddock

For an example of the use of the library, see Highlight.hs.
After installing the library using the steps above, you can compile
this program with the following command:

    ghc Highlight.hs -package highlighting-kate -o Highlight

Or, you can tell Cabal to build the executable along with the
library:

    runghc Setup.lhs configure -fbuildExecutable

To run Highlight, specify the language name using -s:

    ./Highlight -s haskell Highlight.hs > example.html

If you don't specify a language name, Highlight will try to guess it
from the file extension.  For other options,

    ./Highlight --help

Styling is done using span tags, so text will not appear any different
unless an appropriate CSS file is used.  There are two CSS files in
the css directory.  These use generic class names; for more fine-grained
highlighting, users may wish to create their own CSS files that use
language-specific classes.

The parsers in Text/Highlighting/Kate/Syntax were automatically generated
from the Kate syntax definitions in the xml directory. You may modify
the xml files in this directory, or add new ones, and then regenerate
the parsers by doing:

    runghc ParseSyntaxFiles.hs xml

Note that ParseSyntaxFiles.hs requires the HXT package.

You can browse the available Kate syntax highlighting files at

    http://kate-editor.org/downloads/syntax_highlighting

or retrieve them all using Subversion:

    svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/kdelibs/kate/syntax/data kate-data 

There is information on the syntax highlighting definitions at

    http://kate-editor.org/article/writing_a_kate_highlighting_xml_file

Thanks are due to all the authors of these syntax definitions!
Changes have been made to the following xml files (the originals have been
left in the directory, with .bkp extensions):

- javascript.xml:  Fixed regex \s* (which matches empty string) by changes to DetectSpaces
- perl.xml:  Fixed regexes - needed backslash-escapes before ] and ^
- haskell.xml:  Added support for module names

NOTE:  This software is largely untested.  Known bugs are recorded in the file
BUGS. Please send bug reports (or better, patches) to the author (jgm at
berkeley dot edu).
