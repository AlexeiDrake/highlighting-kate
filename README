highlighting-kate is a Haskell source code highlighting library, based
on Kate's syntax description files.

Currently, the following languages are supported:

Ada        Asp              Awk            Bash             Bibtex
C          Cmake            Coldfusion     Commonlisp       Cpp
Css        D                Diff           Djangotemplate   Doxygen
Dtd        Erlang           Fortran        Haskell          Html
Java       Javadoc          Javascript     Json             Latex
Lex        LiterateHaskell  Lua            Makefile         Matlab
Mediawiki  Nasm             Objectivec     Objectivecpp     Ocaml
Pascal     Perl             Php            Postscript       Prolog
Python     Ruby             Scala          Scheme           Sgml
Sql        SqlMysql         SqlPostgresql  Tcl              Texinfo
Xml        Xslt             Yacc

To install:

    runghc Setup.lhs configure
    runghc Setup.lhs build 
    runghc Setup.lhs install 

The last command must be run as root, or --user may be specified to install
the library into the user package database.

For an example of the use of the library, see Highlight.hs.
After installing the library using the steps above, you can compile
this program with the following command:

    ghc Highlight.hs -package highlighting-kate -o Highlight

To run Highlight, provide two arguments, the language name and the
file to be highligted.  For example,

    ./Highlight haskell Highlight.hs > example.html

will highlight Highlight.hs and put the result in example.html.

Styling is done using span tags, so text will not appear any different
unless an appropriate CSS file is used.  There are two CSS files in
the css directory.  These use generic class names; for more fine-grained
highlighting, users may wish to create their own CSS files that use
language-specific classes.

The parsers in Text/Highlighting/Kate/Syntax were automatically generated
from the Kate syntax definitions in the xml directory.  (Note that in a
few cases, the xml files have been modified; the original has been left
with a .orig suffix.)  You may modify the xml files in this directory,
or add new ones, and then regenerate the parsers by doing:

    runghc ParseSyntaxFiles.hs xml

Note that ParseSyntaxFiles.hs requires the HXT package.

You can browse the available Kate syntax highlighting files at

    http://kate-editor.org/downloads/syntax_highlighting

or retrieve them all using Subversion:

    svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/kdelibs/kate/syntax/data kate-data

Thanks are due to all the authors of these syntax definitions!
