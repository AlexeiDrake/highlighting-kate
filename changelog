highlighting-kate 0.2.4 (15 Mar 2009)

  * Fixed bug in literate-haskell-xml. Also fixed now upstream.
    (Bjorn Buckwalter)

  * Modified ParseSyntaxFiles.hs to allow regeneration of individual
    syntax files. With the change ParseSyntaxFiles accepts any number of
    arguments. Those ending with .xml are assumed to be files while the
    rest are assumed to be directories containing .xml files.
    The syntaxes included in Syntax.hs are based on the contents of
    destDir rather than the arguments, this allows regenerating a subset
    of syntaxes but still having all syntaxes in Syntax.hs. (Bjorn Buckwalter)

  * ParseSyntaxFiles.hs: Change deprecated pragma, remove obsolete import.
    (Bjorn Buckwalter)

highlighting-kate 0.2.3 (9 Jul 2008)

  * Removed -O2 in Ghc-Options, as it provides very little speedup

highlighting-kate 0.2.2 (9 Jul 2008)

  * Added Cc-options -O0 to cabal file. This is needed to prevent
    gcc from using enormous amounts of memory on platforms
    that lack a native code generator and compile via C. See
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=469893.

  * Depend on parsec < 3, because parsec 3 is much slower.

  * normalizeHighlighting now strips out empty strings

highlighting-kate 0.2.1 (10 Feb 2008)

  *  Implemented lookAhead in parsers, which fixed bugs in perl, bash,
     and other parsers.

highlighting-kate 0.2 (10 Feb 2008)

  *  Initial release
